Week 1
Used AI to help remember the structure of an if-else statement.
Used AI to revise a different and more efficient way of matching words without having
to write a whole if else statement to make a boolean.
Used AI to revise my code so that strip and replace could go in the same line rather than
in a different line of code and therefore having to make more variables than needed.
Used AI to find out how to print digits behind a specific period

Overall, most AI usage was to briefly refresh on the formatting of different functions
that I wasn't completely clear on but still had some memory of knowing how to do.
